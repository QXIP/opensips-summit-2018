Moreover, they must also take into account concepts such as traversing the NAT in front of contacts, keeping these NAT pinholes alive or being able to easily scale the service up/down while also ensuring a maximal uptime for it. Most state-of-the-art solutions revolve around the usage of a geo-distributed database coupled with some OpenSIPS scripting in order to route calls to the datacenter on which the targeted user is binded. Using this as a starting point, each solution is then customized according to the needs of the provider. In this presentation, the discussion will focus around the designs that went into OpenSIPS 2.4 with the purpose of exposing generic and intuitive script primitives in order to build robust SIP user location services that solve one or more of the above core problems.",
